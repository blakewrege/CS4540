Hello CS 4540 Students,

Here's Assignment 6 (A6). The program involves modifying the internals 
of a working OS. You will write, load, and unload a Ubuntu(Linux) kernel 
module.

The assignment is easy though specs are very long. They are long 
since--in addition to the actual specifications for your program--they 
include examples, explanations, hints, and background information.

Contents of A4:
---------------
Part I.   Creating a Simple Kernel Module
       I.1.  An Illustrative Program for a Simple Kernel Module
       I.2.  Loading and Removing Kernel Modules
Part II.  Creating a Kernel Module Using Kernel Data Structures
       II.1. A Kernel struct and its Description
       II.2. Inserting Elements into the Kernel Linked List
       II.3. Traversing the Kernel Linked List
       II.4. Removing Elements from the Kernel Linked List
Part III. Implement Simple Kernel Module Using Illustrative Program
Part IV.  Implement Linked List Kernel Module
Part V.   Hints
Part VI.  Additional Background Information

The solution must be compiled and run on Ubuntu under Oracle VirtualBox.

Remember about the C style and submission guidelines.

For any issues related to the assignments, contact the TA first.

A6 is due by the end of the day (11:59 p.m.) on Tuesday, April 19.

Good luck.

Hello CS 4540 Students,

Since code component of A6 is trivial, there is no need for SLC for A6 
(SLC documents in detail pseudocode and code development).

Thanks.
